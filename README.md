This Exercice based on a historic dataset of NBA players.

We assume some Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) based on players' height (Exercice 1) and players' weight (Exercice 2). Formulate Alternative Hypothesis and test them.

Overall method consists in sampling n=30 players then perform a statistical T-test and compare the obtained p-values with a given $\alpha$ = 0.05

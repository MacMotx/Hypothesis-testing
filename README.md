# Hypothesis-testing
## S07_01

This Exercice based on a historic dataset of NBA players.

We assume some Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) based on players' height (Exercice 1) and players' weight (Exercice 2).

Formulate Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>) and test them against H<sub>0</sub>.

Overall method consists in sampling n=30 players then perform a statistical T-test and compare the obtained p-values with a given $\alpha$ = 0.05.
